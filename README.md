# Hello... World!

This is my very first version about me here on GitHub!

I'm known as a curious guy! With a wiki, documentation, or a guide, I can quickly understand new technologies.

See my blog where I talk about [technologies and programming](https://www.willianantunes.com/). My old blog one can be consulted [here](https://willianantunes.blogspot.com/).
